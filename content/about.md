    title: "How It Started"
    body: >
      It all began when a few community members realized something: many
      KubeCon attendees were already taking the train and loving it. But for most,
      the two biggest hurdles were cost and travel time. KubeTrain was created to
      overcome those barriers, bringing people together to share the ride, the
      savings, and the excitement.
